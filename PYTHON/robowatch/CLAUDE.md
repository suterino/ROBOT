I want to develop a prooject in python that allows to program a UR5e robot to do welding and polishing.
The input woould be a scan of a 3D object (coould be a watch).
I want to create a GUI that allows me to analysize the stl object, make operation to manipute the object, see from different views, set path on the objects and more.
The output could be the commands in python for UR5e, it will use the python packages: rtde_control, rtde_receive.
